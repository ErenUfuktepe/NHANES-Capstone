    "Blood pressure is the pressure of blood pushing against the walls of arteries. Having high blood pressure can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke, two leading causes of death for Americans. As a primary or contributing cause of death, hypertension was responsible for 516,955 people deaths in the United States in 2019. Studies have shown that nearly half of adults in the United States (47%) have high blood pressure, and among them, only 24% have their condition under control. \n",

    "Many studies have shown that the increased blood pressure has relationship with lifestyle changes, for example, unhealthy nutrition, smoking and drinking etc. However, most of the studies have separately examined the relationship between different lifestyle related factors and hypertension. In fact, lifestyle should be considered in a whole systematic way to a person. In this study, we looked at different lifestyle subgroups characteristics and their relationships with blood pressure.
